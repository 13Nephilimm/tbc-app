Technologies I used for this project:
JavaScript ES6 - for cleaner and more organized code
CSS grid, Flexbox - for better performance, modern code and easy for responsive web.
Next JS, React JS Libraries. 
Vercel Postgress & Blob - For Database and Vercel for deployment.
Project Structure: I used relevant class names, function names and variable names because code will be easy readable for others. also it make a lot of sense. it's fully responsive on any device (PC, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile). In HTML structure I used semantic HTML tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.
